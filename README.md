# Weather Forecast

A possible solution to the 1sti enterprise front end challenge, with the main objective of testing my skills in front end technologies.

The challenge: https://github.com/1STi/desafio-frontend/

The objective of the challenge was to create a simple page that consumes Yahoo's weather forecasting API 

For this project I used:
- React
- Sass for css
- Standard Lint
- Axios for http requests

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:

Clone or download this repository

install dependencies using: 

```
npm i || yarn
```

to run in development mode use:

```
npm run dev || yarn dev
```

This will start a webpack server on localhost on port 3000 running the application
just go to http://localhost:3000 and use

## To build 

use: 

```
npm run build || yarn build
```

A folder named 'dist' will be created from the project directory with the bundle files
